Timeout to all proxy-methods
Start all methods beginning with 'work'
Check that nested calls via proxy works, i.e zp.hej.gustav()
Handle each incomming command in separate thread, this is needed
  so that socket can receive new commands. Keep cache of ongoing connections.
Start and stop daemon from commandline
await_reply flag, if False, return msg immediately without waiting for execution
Lookup server that allows hostname to be left out if it is unique.
Catch ctrl-c and exit nicely
